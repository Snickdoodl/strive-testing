                <u>Strengths &amp; Weaknesses in Guilty Gear Strive</u>

            </h1>

            <p>

                Many people playing Guilty Gear Strive often complain about the characters their opponents play, but they very rarely know what makes them strong or how to beat them. This leads to disorganized, pointless arguing over certain characters and moves. This website strives to clear the futility from these discussions and show what exactly makes certain characters strong, and how to beat them.

                <ul>

                    <li><b>Fast buttons</b><br>Sol has many fast pokes to extend his pressure and dominate the neutral. His non-commital <span class="slash">6s</span> and his plus-on-block <span class="slash">f.s</span> give him the buttons he needs to easily win.</li>

                    <li><b>Block pressure</b><br>Sol has a variety of plus-on-block moves that bolster his pressure. Both his <span class="slash">c.s</span> and <span class="slash">f.s</span>, and can be even further improved by gatling them into his overheads and lows. His <span class="heavy">41236h</span> can also lock you down and open you up to tick throws.</li>

                    <li><b>Incredible defense</b><br>Sol has many great defensive options. His 3 frame <span class="kick">5k</span> can be used abare in multiple situations to break out of pressure. In addition, he has 3 invincible reversals, two of which require no meter.<br></li>

                        <li><b>Terrible movement</b><br>Potemkin has no dash or air dash. In addition, his main approach tool, <span class="heavy">[4]6H</span>, is highly punishable by most characters.</li>

                        <li><b>Zoning issues</b><br>Because of his terrible movement, he often struggles with zoning. He has <span class="slash">63214s</span>. to deal with this, but it only works on projectiles.</li>

            <div class="procon" style="display:block">

                <h3 style="text-align:center">Pros</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li><b>High damage</b><br>Goldlewis has incredible damage, being able to easily ToD most characters at high risk. In addition, his Behemoth Typhoons provide a large amount of chip, even when your opponent is blocking.</li>

                    <li><b>Block Pressure</b><br>Goldlewis has a plethora of plus on block moves. On top of that, many of his Behmoth Typhoons guard crush. Use this in combination with the fact that the Typhoons do  massive amounts of chip to get formidable offense against a blocking opponent.</li>

                    <li><b>Strong Okizeme</b><br>Goldlewis has many ways of scoring a hard knockdown, and can use them to set up <span class="slash">214s</span> or counter-hit the opponent with a meaty <span class="heavy">6h</span> or <span class="heavy">63214h</span>.</li>

                <h3 style="text-align:center">Cons</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li><b>Slow frame data</b><br>Goldlewis has very slow moves, with his fastest being his 6 frame <span class="punch">2p</span>. Because of this, he lacks abare options, leading to your pressure being safer.</li>

                    <li><b>Slow movement</b><br>Goldlewis has one of the slowest runs in the game, paired with an equally slow air dash. He also lacks unique movement options, which makes Goldlewis susceptible to zoning.</li>

                    <li><b>Zoning issues</b><br>Goldlewis lacks moves with a large range. His two main anti-zoning tools, <span class="slash">214s</span> and <span class="slash">236s</span>, are meter reliant and highly punishable.</li>
